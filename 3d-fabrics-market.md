<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Woven</li><li>Orthogonal Nonwoven</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The woven market of 3D fabrics involves interlacing two or more sets of yarns at right angles, creating a strong and durable fabric. On the other hand, the orthogonal nonwoven market consists of fabrics made by bonding fibers together in a specific pattern without weaving or knitting. These fabrics offer great dimensional stability and are suitable for industrial applications. Both woven and orthogonal nonwoven fabrics are commonly used in the 3D fabrics market due to their ability to provide unique structural and functional characteristics.</p></p>
