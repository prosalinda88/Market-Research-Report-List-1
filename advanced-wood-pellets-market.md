<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Advanced Wood Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The advanced wood pellets market encompasses different types such as torrefaction and steam explosion. Torrefaction involves roasting the wood biomass at high temperatures to remove moisture and produce a denser pellet that has higher energy content and improved stability. On the other hand, steam explosion utilizes steam to soften the lignocellulosic materials, making them more susceptible to chemical and mechanical treatment. This process enhances the pellet's durability and thermal properties, leading to high-quality fuel for various applications in the biomass industry.</p></p>
