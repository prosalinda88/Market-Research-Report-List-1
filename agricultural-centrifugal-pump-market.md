<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Centrifugal Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage Pump</li><li>Multi-stage Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Agricultural centrifugal pumps are classified into two main types: single-stage pump and multi-stage pump. The single-stage pump is designed with only one impeller and is primarily used for low-pressure applications. It is suitable for transferring water, chemicals, or other fluids in agricultural settings. On the other hand, a multi-stage pump consists of multiple impellers stacked together, enabling it to generate higher pressures. It is commonly used for irrigation systems, water supply, or in cases where high pressure is required in agricultural operations.</p></p>
