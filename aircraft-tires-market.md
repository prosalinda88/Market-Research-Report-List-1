<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aircraft tires market can be categorized into two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with layers of cords plied together at 90-degree angles to the direction of travel, which allows the tire to resist heat build-up and provides better fuel efficiency. On the other hand, bias tires are constructed with layers of cords crisscrossed diagonally, providing sturdy sidewalls and high load-carrying capacity. Both types of tires are used in aircraft, with radial tires offering advantages in terms of performance and fuel efficiency compared to bias tires.</p></p>
