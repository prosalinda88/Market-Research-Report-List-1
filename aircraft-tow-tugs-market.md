<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tow Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Towbarless Tractors</li><li>Conventional Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft tow tugs are used to tow aircrafts within airports. There are two main types of tow tugs: towbarless tractors and conventional tractors. Towbarless tractors are designed without a towbar and use mechanical arms or lift pads to lift and move the aircraft. This type offers greater maneuverability and reduces the risk of damage to the aircraft. Conventional tractors, on the other hand, use a towbar that physically connects to the airplane's nose gear. They are simpler in design and are suitable for towing smaller aircrafts.</p></p>
