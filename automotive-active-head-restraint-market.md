<p><strong>The Automotive Active Head Restraint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adjustable Head Restraint</li><li>Active Head Restraint</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive Active Head Restraint is a safety system incorporated in vehicles to reduce the risk of head and neck injuries during collisions. There are two main types of active head restraints: adjustable head restraints and active head restraints. Adjustable head restraints can be customized based on the occupant's height and position, providing optimal support and protection. On the other hand, active head restraints are designed to automatically deploy and move forward during rear-end collisions. This motion helps to minimize the whiplash effect and avoid potential injuries. Both types of head restraints contribute to improving passenger safety in automobiles.</p></p>
