<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-based</li><li>Water-based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aviation adhesives and sealants are essential for maintaining structural integrity and sealing various components in aircraft. The market is divided into two types: solvent-based and water-based. Solvent-based adhesives contain volatile organic compounds that evaporate during curing, providing strong bonding properties. They are suitable for high-stress applications but can pose environmental and health risks. Water-based adhesives, on the other hand, rely on water as a carrier, making them more environmentally friendly and safer to use. These adhesives offer advantages such as easy cleanup, but may have slightly lower strength compared to solvent-based alternatives.</p></p>
