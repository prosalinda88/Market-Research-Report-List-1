<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barge Unloaders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intermittent Barge Unloaders</li><li>Continuous Barge Unloaders</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Barge unloaders refer to equipment used to unload cargo from barges. Intermittent barge unloaders are designed to unload cargo in batches, wherein the equipment is operated periodically with loading and unloading cycles. On the other hand, continuous barge unloaders allow for a continuous flow of cargo, without the need for intermittent operations. Both types serve the purpose of efficiently transferring cargo from barges, but intermittent unloaders are suitable for smaller volumes and regular intervals, while continuous unloaders are better suited for larger volumes and continuous operations.</p></p>
