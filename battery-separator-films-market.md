<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Battery Separator Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Method</li><li>Wet Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Battery Separator Films Market includes two types of manufacturing methods: Dry Method and Wet Method. In the Dry Method, the battery separator film is produced by extruding a polymer solution on a casting belt, which is dried to form a solid film. On the other hand, the Wet Method involves immersing a spinning wheel into a polymer solution, which then creates a film as the wheel rotates and the solvent evaporates. These different methods help meet the diverse requirements of battery manufacturers in terms of performance and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
