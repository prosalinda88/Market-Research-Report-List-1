<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiovascular Microcatheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Lumen</li><li>Dual Lumen</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The cardiovascular microcatheter market is segmented into two types: single lumen and dual lumen. A single lumen microcatheter consists of a single channel or pathway through which medical professionals can insert and navigate medical devices into the cardiovascular system. It is commonly used for diagnostic purposes or delivering medication. On the other hand, a dual lumen microcatheter has two separate lumens or channels, allowing for simultaneous delivery of multiple devices or substances. This type of microcatheter is often used for more complex interventions or procedures requiring multiple functions.</p></p>
