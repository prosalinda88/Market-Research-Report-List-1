<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clay Stabilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-swelling Ratio≥70 %</li><li>Anti-swelling Ratio≥90%</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Clay Stabilizer market consists of two main types: Anti-swelling Ratio≥70% and Anti-swelling Ratio≥90%. In the Anti-swelling Ratio≥70% market, the stabilizers have the ability to prevent clay particles from swelling by at least 70%. This helps maintain the stability of the formation during drilling operations. On the other hand, the Anti-swelling Ratio≥90% market offers stabilizers that can prevent clay swelling by at least 90%. These highly effective stabilizers are particularly useful in combating the challenges posed by highly reactive clay formations.</p></p>
