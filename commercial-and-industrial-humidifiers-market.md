<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial and Industrial Humidifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adiabatic</li><li>Direct Injection Steam</li><li>Heated Tank</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Commercial and industrial humidifiers are devices used to increase the humidity levels in commercial or industrial settings. There are three main types of humidifiers: adiabatic, direct injection steam, and heated tank. </p><p>Adiabatic humidifiers operate by using evaporation to increase the humidity levels. They use air or water to create a fine mist that is then released into the environment.</p><p>Direct injection steam humidifiers inject steam directly into the air, quickly increasing the humidity levels. This method is often used in applications that require precise humidity control.</p><p>Heated tank humidifiers heat the water in a tank and then release it as steam into the air. They are commonly used in larger spaces or industrial settings that require a high amount of humidity.</p></p>
