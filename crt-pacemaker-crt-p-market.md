<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CRT Pacemaker (CRT-P) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extracorporeal Portable Pacemaker</li><li>Implanted Pacemaker</li><li>Semi-Buried Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CRT-P market consists of three main types: extracorporeal portable pacemakers, implanted pacemakers, and semi-buried pacemakers. Extracorporeal portable pacemakers are external devices that are temporarily attached to the body. Implanted pacemakers are surgically placed inside the chest, directly connected to the heart. Semi-buried pacemakers are partially implanted devices, placed just below the skin. Each type serves the purpose of regulating the heart's rhythms, but they differ in terms of convenience, invasiveness, and permanence of placement.</p></p>
