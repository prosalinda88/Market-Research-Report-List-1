<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dimer Fatty Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard</li><li>Distilled</li><li>Distilled and Hydrogenated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dimer fatty acid market includes three main types: standard, distilled, and distilled and hydrogenated. Standard dimer fatty acids are produced by a simple dimerization process of unsaturated fatty acids, resulting in a mixture of dimer acids. Distilled dimer fatty acid is obtained after a purification process to remove impurities and unwanted components. Distilled and hydrogenated dimer fatty acid undergoes an additional step of hydrogenation, improving the stability and melting point of the final product. These different types cater to diverse applications in industries such as coatings, adhesives, lubricants, and resins.</p></p>
