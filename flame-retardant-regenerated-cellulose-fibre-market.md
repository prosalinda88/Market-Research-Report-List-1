<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Regenerated Cellulose Fibre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Silicon Flame Retardant</li><li>Phosphorous Flame Retardant</li><li>Phosphorus and Nitrogen Flame Retardant</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The flame retardant regenerated cellulose fiber market can be classified into various types based on the types of flame retardants used. </p><p>1. Silicon flame retardant: This type of flame retardant contains silicon-based compounds that provide excellent flame resistance to the cellulose fiber. These compounds create a protective barrier when exposed to fire, preventing the spread of flames.</p><p>2. Phosphorous flame retardant: Phosphorous-based flame retardants are widely used in the industry. They work by releasing a non-combustible gas when exposed to heat or flame, thus reducing the flammability of the cellulose fiber.</p><p>3. Phosphorus and nitrogen flame retardant: These flame retardants combine the benefits of both phosphorus and nitrogen compounds. They not only release non-combustible gases but also create a char barrier on the fiber surface, further enhancing its flame resistance.</p><p>4. Other market: Apart from the mentioned types, there are various other flame retardant options available in the market. These could include halogen-based flame retardants, intumescent flame retardants, or combinations of different chemicals to achieve desired flame resistance properties in regenerated cellulose fibers.</p></p>
