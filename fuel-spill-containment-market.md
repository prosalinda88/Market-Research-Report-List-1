<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Spill Containment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Remote-Fill Type</li><li>Direct-Fill Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fuel spill containment market consists of two main types: remote-fill type and direct-fill type. The remote-fill type is designed to prevent fuel spills during the refueling process by using a remote-fill station located away from the fuel tank. This helps to minimize the risk of environmental contamination and ensures efficient fuel handling. On the other hand, the direct-fill type involves a fuel spill containment system that is directly integrated with the fuel tank, reducing the chances of spills during refueling and enhancing safety measures. Both types contribute to preventing fuel spills and protecting the environment.</p></p>
