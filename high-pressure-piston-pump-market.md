<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Piston Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Piston Pump</li><li>Radial Piston Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The high-pressure piston pump market consists of two types: axial piston pumps and radial piston pumps. Axial piston pumps have pistons arranged in a circular pattern, parallel to the input shaft, and the fluid is pushed linearly through the pump. These pumps are commonly used in applications that require high pressure and variable flow rates. On the other hand, radial piston pumps have pistons arranged in a radial pattern around a central camshaft, which generates a rotary motion to move the fluid. These pumps are commonly utilized in applications that require high pressure and constant flow rates.</p></p>
