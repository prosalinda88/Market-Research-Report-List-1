<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Voltage Power Cable for EV and HEV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shielded</li><li>Not Shielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High voltage power cables for the EV and HEV market can be categorized into shielded and not shielded types. Shielded cables have an insulating layer that provides protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI), reducing the risk of signal degradation. This makes them suitable for applications where EMI is a concern. On the other hand, not shielded cables lack this additional insulation layer, offering a more cost-effective option for applications that do not require protection against EMI. The choice between shielded and not shielded cables depends on the specific requirements of the EV or HEV system.</p></p>
