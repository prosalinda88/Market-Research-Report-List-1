<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ice Melt Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Ice Melter</li><li>Liquid Ice Melter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ice Melt Products market consists of two types: Solid Ice Melter and Liquid Ice Melter. Solid Ice Melter refers to products that come in the form of granules or pellets, typically made from various salts or chemicals. When applied to icy surfaces, they slowly dissolve and create a brine solution that melts the ice. On the other hand, Liquid Ice Melter includes solutions or sprays that are directly applied to the ice. They quickly penetrate the ice, breaking its bond and speeding up the melting process. Both types play a vital role in combating ice and ensuring safety during winter seasons.</p></p>
