<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Truck Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Light Truck Tyre Market includes two main types of tires: Radial Tire and Bias Tire. Radial tires are constructed with ply cords extending from bead to bead, perpendicular to the tread. This design provides better traction, improved fuel efficiency, and a smoother ride. On the other hand, Bias tires have crisscrossed ply cords in a diagonal pattern, resulting in a stronger sidewall and greater resistance to punctures. However, they tend to have lower fuel efficiency and a rougher ride compared to radial tires.</p></p>
