<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHIs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-Agglomerate (AA) Inhibitors</li><li>Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors (KHI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low-dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHIs) are chemicals used to prevent the formation and agglomeration of hydrates in oil and gas pipelines. The AA inhibitors help to prevent the agglomeration or clustering of hydrate crystals, ensuring their efficient dispersion and flow. On the other hand, the KHI inhibitors work by shifting the thermodynamic conditions, lowering the temperature and pressure at which hydrates can form. Both AA and KHI inhibitors contribute to the safe and uninterrupted transportation of oil and gas, reducing the risk of hydrate blockages and associated operational issues.</p></p>
