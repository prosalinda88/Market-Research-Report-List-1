<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metalworking Coolants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-water Soluble</li><li>Water Soluble</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Metalworking coolants are important in the machining industry to lubricate and cool down the cutting tools during the manufacturing process. Non-water soluble coolants, such as oils, do not mix with water and offer excellent lubrication and heat transfer properties. They are suitable for heavy-duty applications but can be more expensive. On the other hand, water-soluble coolants, like emulsions and synthetics, can be easily mixed with water, providing effective cooling and rust protection. These coolants are cost-effective but may require regular maintenance and cause potential health risks due to bacterial growth if not properly managed.</p></p>
