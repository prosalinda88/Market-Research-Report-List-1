<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orphan Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biologics</li><li>Non-Biologics</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The orphan drug market consists of two types: biologics and non-biologics. Biologics are medicinal products created from living organisms and include gene therapies, vaccines, and cell therapies. Non-biologics, on the other hand, are medicinal products produced through chemical synthesis, such as small molecules and drugs. Both biologics and non-biologics cater to rare diseases, which affect a small population, and often require extensive research and development due to limited market potential. These drugs aim to provide effective treatment options for rare diseases that may not have previously had any approved treatments available.</p></p>
