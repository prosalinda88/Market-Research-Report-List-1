<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Reactive Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-sagging Adhesive</li><li>Self-leveling Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyurethane Reactive Adhesive is classified into two main types: Non-sagging Adhesive and Self-leveling Adhesive. Non-sagging Adhesive is a thick and viscous adhesive that maintains its shape and does not drip when applied vertically or overhead. It is suitable for bonding materials with vertical or inclined surfaces. On the other hand, Self-leveling Adhesive is a more fluid and low-viscosity adhesive that flows and levels itself to create a smooth and even surface. It is ideal for horizontal or uneven surfaces where it can easily spread and level out.</p></p>
