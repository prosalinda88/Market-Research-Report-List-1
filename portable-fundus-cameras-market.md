<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Fundus Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li><li>Non-Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The portable fundus cameras market consists of two main types: mydriatic and non-mydriatic fundus cameras. Mydriatic cameras require the use of eye-dilating drops to obtain clear images of the retina. They offer higher image quality but may cause discomfort and blurred vision for a few hours. Non-mydriatic cameras, on the other hand, do not require dilation and provide less clear images. Although they offer a more convenient and comfortable experience for patients, they may not be suitable for certain medical conditions or detailed examinations.</p></p>
