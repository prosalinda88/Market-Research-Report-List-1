<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quartz Countertops Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Press Molding</li><li>Casting Molding</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The quartz countertops market can be characterized into two main types: press molding and casting molding. In press molding, the quartz slabs are produced by compressing a mixture of quartz and resin under high pressure and heat. This method ensures a consistent and compact slab with a smooth surface. On the other hand, casting molding involves pouring the quartz mixture into molds and allowing it to harden at room temperature or through a curing process. This method allows for more design flexibility and variations in texture and pattern in the final quartz countertops.</p></p>
