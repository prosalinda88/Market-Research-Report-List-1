<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refractory Gunning Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Powder Mixing</li><li>Wet Mixing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The refractory gunning machine market is segmented into two types: dry powder mixing market and wet mixing market. In the dry powder mixing market, the machine is designed to mix and spray dry refractory materials onto surfaces, using compressed air. This process ensures good adhesion and minimizes rebound. On the other hand, the wet mixing market involves a machine that mixes refractory materials with water to create a slurry, which is then sprayed onto surfaces. This method offers advantages such as better workability and reduced dust generation.</p></p>
