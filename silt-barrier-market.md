<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silt Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WovenFibres</li><li>Non-WovenFibres</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The silt barrier market consists of two main types: woven fibers and non-woven fibers. Woven fiber silt barriers are made by interlacing strong threads together, creating a tightly woven fabric. These barriers provide excellent strength and durability, making them suitable for long-term use. On the other hand, non-woven fiber silt barriers are created by bonding or felting synthetic or natural fibers together. They provide effective filtration and sediment retention capabilities. Both types of barriers are commonly used in erosion control and sediment containment applications to prevent silt and sediment from polluting water bodies.</p></p>
