<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Strip Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Rolled</li><li>Cold Rolled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The steel strip market consists of two main types: hot rolled and cold rolled. Hot rolled steel strip is produced by heating a steel slab above its recrystallization temperature and then rolling it into a thin strip. This type is known for its higher strength and rough surface texture. On the other hand, cold rolled steel strip is made by further processing hot rolled steel through cold reduction techniques. It offers improved dimensional accuracy, smoother surface finish, and better mechanical properties, making it preferred for applications requiring precise tolerances and surface quality.</p></p>
