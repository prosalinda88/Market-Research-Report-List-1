<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Power Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Core Cable</li><li>Multi Core Cable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The submarine power cable market consists of two types: single core cable and multi-core cable. Single core cables are designed with a single conductor surrounded by protective layers. These cables are suitable for long-distance power transmission, as they provide lower transmission losses and higher current carrying capacity. On the other hand, multi-core cables have multiple conductors, each insulated and protected individually. They are commonly used for power distribution networks and provide flexibility in terms of installation and maintenance. Both types of cables play a crucial role in transmitting electrical power underwater efficiently and reliably.</p></p>
