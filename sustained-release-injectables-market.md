<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sustained Release Injectables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microparticles</li><li>Implants</li><li>Gels</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The sustained release injectables market consists of various types, namely microparticles, implants, and gels. Microparticles are small particles that are injected into the body and gradually release the medication over a prolonged period of time. Implants are placed under the skin and slowly release the drug over an extended period. Gels, on the other hand, are a semi-solid substance that is injected and forms a depot, allowing for slow release of the medication. These different types of sustained release injectables provide patients with an alternative to regular medication administration and ensure a steady and controlled release of drugs.</p></p>
