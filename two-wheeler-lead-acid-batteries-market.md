<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two Wheeler Lead Acid Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VRLA Batteries</li><li>Flooded Batteries</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the Two Wheeler Lead Acid Batteries market, there are two main types of batteries available â€“ VRLA (Valve Regulated Lead Acid) Batteries and Flooded Batteries. VRLA batteries are sealed and maintenance-free, using oxygen recombination to prevent the escape of gases and avoid the need for adding water. These batteries offer high energy density and are suitable for applications requiring minimal maintenance. On the other hand, Flooded Batteries have an open design and require regular watering to maintain electrolyte levels. They are typically less expensive but require more maintenance.</p></p>
